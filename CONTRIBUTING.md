## Development Workflow

### Branching Model

Always create a new feature branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/my-bugfix
```

### Formatting and Linting

We enforce strict formatting and linting rules using **ESLint** and **Prettier**. You can run these checks locally:

- Run linter: `pnpm run lint`
- Check formatting: `pnpm run format:check`
- Fix formatting: `pnpm run format:write`

### Git Commit Conventions

We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification. Commits must be structured as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types include:

- `feat`: A new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script
- `fix`: A bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script
- `docs`: Changes to the documentation
- `style`: Formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change
- `refactor`: Refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable
- `test`: Adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change
- `chore`: Updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(sdk): add Stellar wallet connection hook"
```
